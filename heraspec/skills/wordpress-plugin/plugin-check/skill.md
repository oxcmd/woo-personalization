# Skill: WordPress Plugin Check (PCP)

This skill automates the process of running the WordPress Plugin Check tool and fixing the reported issues.

## Purpose

To identify and resolve issues flagged by the WordPress Plugin Check (PCP) tool to ensure the plugin meets WordPress.org standards.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Install Plugin Check (PCP)**:
    - You MUST have the [Plugin Check (PCP)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/) plugin installed and active on your WordPress site.
    - CLI command relies on this plugin to generate reports.

2.  **Configure wp-config.php**:
    - Ensure your `wp-config.php` uses `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for database host if you encounter connection issues with CLI.
    - Example: `define( 'DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1' );`

## Required Variables

- `{{plugin_folder_name}}`: The actual folder name of the target plugin (e.g., `poly-locations-manager` or `my-awesome-plugin`).
  > **Note**: `polyutilities` in examples is just a placeholder. ALWAYS replace it with the actual plugin slug you are working on.

## Agent Usage & Examples

### Triggering the Skill

Users may ask to "check plugin [name]" or "run plugin check".

**Example Prompt (Reference Only):**
> "Use skill plugin-check to check, then resolve *all* issues mentioned for plugin `[TARGET_PLUGIN_NAME]`. Ensure careful handling and verify that related features still function correctly. If uncertain about any fix, add a TODO note in the code instead of applying a risky change."

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**:
- Replace `[TARGET_PLUGIN_NAME]` with the actual plugin folder name provided by the user.
- IF the user does not specify a name, infer it from the current working directory or the `wp-content/plugins/` structure.
- **DO NOT** default to `polyutilities` unless the user specifically asked for it.

### Process Flow

#### Step 1: Run Plugin Check

1. **Identify Plugin Folder**: Ensure you are in the root workspace of the project. The plugin folder is usually the one you are currently working on.
2. **Execute Command**: Run the following command to generate the report. Replace `{{plugin_folder_name}}` with the actual directory name of the plugin.
   ```bash
   mkdir -p wp-content/plugins/{{plugin_folder_name}}/_pcp && wp plugin check {{plugin_folder_name}} --exclude-files=.DS_Store,.sh,.md --exclude-directories=documentations,heraspec,node_modules,tests,dist,_pcp --format=table > wp-content/plugins/{{plugin_folder_name}}/_pcp/pcp.txt
   ```

#### Step 2: Review and Confirm

1. **Read Report**: Read the content of `wp-content/plugins/{{plugin_folder_name}}/_pcp/pcp.txt`.
2. **Notify User**: Inform the user about the number or types of issues found.
3. **Wait for Confirmation**: Do NOT proceed to fix issues automatically without user confirmation unless explicitly authorized to "fix all".

#### Step 3: Fix Issues (Iterative)

1. **Target**: Aim to resolve **all** reported errors and warnings, ensuring no new issues are introduced.
2. **Safety First**: Ensure code changes do not break existing functionality.
   * **Uncertainty**: If a fix is risky or unclear, DO NOT apply it blindly. Instead, add a comment `// TODO: [PCP] Fix this issue manually - [Reason]` and move to the next item.
3. **Iterate**:
   * Apply fixes for a batch of issues.
   * **Re-run Check**: Run the command from Step 1 again to verify fixes.
   * Repeat until the report is clean or only contains intentional TODOs.

## Custom Fix Patterns

Use these patterns to address issues that the local PCP tool might miss or flag incorrectly.

### MissingVersion Fix

**Description**: This skill documents how to address the `WordPress.WP.EnqueuedResourceParameters.MissingVersion` warning. This occurs when `wp_register_style()`, `wp_enqueue_style()`, `wp_register_script()`, or `wp_enqueue_script()` are called without a version number.

**Pattern to Identify**: Look for calls where the version argument (the 4th argument) is missing or set to `false`/`null` for local/plugin resources.

**Example Warning**:
> Resource version not set in call to `wp_register_style()`. This means new versions of the style may not always be loaded due to browser caching.

**Recommended Fix**: Always provide a version number. Use a global plugin/theme version constant if available, falling back to a default or `filemtime` for local assets.

**Implementation Pattern**:
```php
// 1. Define the version (Replace <PLUGIN_PREFIX> with your actual plugin/theme prefix)
$version = defined( '<PLUGIN_PREFIX>_VERSION' ) ? <PLUGIN_PREFIX>_VERSION : '1.0.0';

// 2. Pass it to the function
wp_register_style(
    'my-handle',
    false,      // Source (false for inline-only handles)
    array(),    // Dependencies
    $version    // Version (CRITICAL)
);
```

**Why this is important**: WordPress uses the version number to generate a query string (e.g., `?ver=1.0.0`) attached to the asset URL. When you update your product, changing the version number forces browsers to download the new files instead of using stale cached versions.

### NonPrefixedHooknameFound Fix

**Description**: WordPress Coding Standards require plugin/theme hooks (actions/filters) to be prefixed. However, when using core WP hooks or known third-party hooks, this warning triggers correctly.

**Pattern to Identify**:
> WARNING: Hook names invoked by a theme/plugin should start with the theme/plugin prefix. Found: "the_content".

**Recommended Fix**: If using a standard WordPress hook or a known third-party hook, use the `phpcs:disable` / `phpcs:enable` toggle to suppress the warning for that specific instance.

```php
// phpcs:disable WordPress.NamingConventions.PrefixAllGlobals.NonPrefixedHooknameFound
$description = apply_filters( 'the_content', $post_content );
// phpcs:enable
```

---

### NonPrefixedVariableFound Fix

**Description**: Global variables or variables defined in the global scope (like in template files or shared configuration) must be prefixed with a unique slug to prevent collisions.

**Pattern to Identify**:
> WARNING: Global variables defined by a theme/plugin should start with the theme/plugin prefix. Found: "$options".

**Recommended Fix**: Rename the variable to include your unique product prefix (e.g., `<plugin_prefix>_`).

#### Before
```php
$options = array( 'key' => 'value' );
```

#### After
```php
$<plugin_prefix>_options = array( 'key' => 'value' );
```

## Best Practices

- **Placeholders**: Replace `<PLUGIN_PREFIX>` (uppercase) and `<plugin_prefix>` (lowercase) with your actual project prefix throughout the implementation.
- **Global Scope**: Be especially careful with short variable names in common files like `functions.php` or template parts.
- **Hook Names**: Always prefix custom hooks. Only disable the check for established external hooks.

## Strict Prohibitions

1.  **DO NOT DELETE Excluded Files**:
    - The command excludes `.sh`, `.md`, `.DS_Store` and directories `heraspec`, `tests`, `docs`.
    - **NEVER** delete or modify these files/directories as part of the fix. They are intentionally excluded because they are development assets, not production garbage.
    - If `wp plugin check` complains about them (it shouldn't if excluded), **IGNORE** those specific errors.

2.  **Scope**: Only modify files within the plugin directory that are relevant to the actual PHP/JS/CSS code being checked.

## Tips

- Common issues include missing escaping (`esc_html`, `esc_attr`), missing nonces, or direct DB access without preparation.
- Always verify that fixes do not break existing functionality.
